      "Summary: Kerala (English:   KERR-ə-lə, Malayalam: [ˈkeːɾɐɭɐm] ) is a state on the Malabar Coast of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore. Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 14th smallest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.\n",
      "The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in 1949. The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara, and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks).\n",
      "Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index (HDI), 0.784 in 2018 (0.712 in 2015); the highest literacy rate, 96.2% in the 2018 literacy survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, India; the highest life expectancy, 77.3 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. Kerala is the least impoverished state in India according to NITI Aayog's Sustainable Development Goals dashboard and Reserve Bank of India's Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy. Kerala is the second-most urbanised major state in the country with 47.7% urban population according to the 2011 Census of India. The state topped in the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals according to the annual report of NITI Aayog published in 2019. The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly Malayalam and sometimes English. Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity.\n",
      "In 2019–20, the economy of Kerala was the 8th-largest in India with ₹8.55 trillion (US$100 billion) in gross state domestic product (GSDP) and a per capita net state domestic product of ₹222,000 (US$2,600). \n",
      "In 2019–20, the tertiary sector contributed around 65% to state's GSVA, while the primary sector contributed only 8%. The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. The production of pepper and natural rubber contributes significantly to the total national output. In the agricultural sector, coconut, tea, coffee, cashew and spices are important. The state is situated between Arabian Sea to the west and Western Ghats mountain\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary: Kerala (English:   KERR-ə-lə, Malayalam: [ˈkeːɾɐɭɐm] ) is a state on the Malabar Coast of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore. Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 14th smallest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.\n",
      "The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in 1949. The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara, and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks).\n",

(December 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)The official logo of Kerala TourismKerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern India, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler,[1] Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters.[2] Kerala has unique culture and traditions coupled with its varied demography. Several international agencies ranging from UNESCO to National Geographic have recognised the state\\'s tourism potential.[3] Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50 extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the World\\'s Greatest Places.[4] In 2023, Kerala was listed at the 13th spot in The New York Times\\' annual list of places to visit and was the only tourist destination listed from India.[5]Kerala House Boat, AlapuzhaVembanad LakeKovalam Beach, TrivandrumMunnarJew Town, Fort KochiPadmanabhaswamy Temple, ThiruvanthapuramJatayu Earth\\'s Center Nature ParkUntil the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination, with most tourism circuits concentrated around the north of the country. Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation—the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state—laid the foundation for the growth of the tourism industry. In the decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to transform itself into one of the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala – God\\'s Own Country was adopted in its tourism promotions and became a global superbrand. Kerala is regarded as one of the destinations with the highest brand recall.[6] In 2010, Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign tourist arrivals.[7]Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists. Kerala is well known for its beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries. Other popular attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam, Muzhappilangad, Bekal and Kappad; backwater tourism and lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam; hill stations and resorts at Munnar, Wayanad, Nelliampathi, Vagamon and Ponmudi; and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries at Wayanad, Periyar, Parambikulam, Silent Valley National Park and Eravikulam National Park. The \"backwaters\" region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre on Vembanad Lake, also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace, Hill Palace, and Mattancherry Palace, are also visited. To further promote tourism in Kerala, the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the Government of Kerala in 2007.[8] Since then it has been held every year during the December–January period.The state\\'s tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture, wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local population. Efforts are taken to minimize the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment and enhance the cultural integrity of local people. The state has also made deep inroads into MICE Tourism mainly centered at Kochi.[9]Historical context[edit]Resorts dot the lengths and breadths of Kerala.Since its incorporation as a state, Kerala\\'s economy largely operated under welfare-based democratic socialist principles. This mode of development, though it resulted in a high Human Development Index and standard of living among the people, led to an economic stagnation in the 1980s (growth rate are 2.3% annually).[10] This apparent paradox—high human development and low economic development—led to a large number of educated unemployed seeking jobs overseas, especially in the Gulf countries.[citation needed] Due to a large number of expatriates, many travel operators and agencies set up shop in the state to facilitate their travel needs. However, the trends soon reciprocated, with the travel agencies noticing the unrealised potential of the state as a tourist destination. The first travel agency in Kerala, Kerala Travels, was founded by Col G.V. Raja of the Travancore royal family along with P.G.C. Pillai.[citation needed]Number of tourists by nationalityNo.CountryTourists1\\xa0United Kingdom186,0852\\xa0United States109,8593\\xa0France97,8944\\xa0Germany67,4255\\xa0Saudi Arabia58,4226\\xa0Maldives52,2367\\xa0Australia42,0898\\xa0Malaysia40,1979\\xa0Oman38,61910\\xa0Russia35,066As of 2019[11]By 1986, tourism had gained an industry status. Kerala Tourism subsequently adopted the tagline God\\'s Own Country in its advertisement campaigns. Aggressive promotion in print and electronic media was able to invite a sizable investment in the hospitality industry. By the early 2000s, tourism had grown into a full-fledged, multi-billion-dollar industry in the state. The state was able to carve a niche for itself in the world tourism industry, thus becoming one of the places with the \"highest brand recall\".[12] In 2003, Kerala, became one of the fastest-growing tourism destination in the world.[13]In 2012, National Geographic\\'s Traveller magazine named Kerala as one of the \"ten paradises of the world\" and \"50 must see destinations of a lifetime\". Travel and Leisure also described Kerala as \"One of the 100 great trips for the 21st century\". In 2012, Kerala overtook the Taj Mahal to be the number one travel destination in Google\\'s search trends for India. CNN Travel listed Kerala amongst its \\'19 best places to visit in 2019. Time magazine picked Kerala among 50 ‘extraordinary destinations’ across the globe to explore in 2022. The state was ranked ninth in the ‘World\\'s Greatest Places\\' and was described as an ‘eco-tourism hot spot\\'.[14] In 2023, The New York Times selected Kerala as one of the 52 must-see tourism destinations in the world. Kerala was selected as thirteenth in the list and was the only state in the list from India.[15]Arrivals of number of tourist between 2012 and 2022YearTotal Tourists ArrivedDomesticInternationalTotal Visitors% of ChangeTotal Visitors% of Change202321,871,64121,222,584 12.48%649,057 87.83%202219,212,96318,867,414 150.31%345,549 471.28%20217,598,1047,537,617 51.09%60,487 82.25%20205,329,7274,988,972 72.86%340,755 71.36%201919,574,00418,384,233 17.81%1,189,771 8.52%201816,701,06815,604,661 6.35%1,096,407 0.42%201715,765,39014,673,520 11.39%1,091,870 5.15%201614,210,95413,172,535 5.67%1,038,419 6.23%201513,443,05012,465,571 6.59%977,479 5.86%201412,618,77711,695,411 7.71%923,366 7.60%201311,445,95410,857,811 7.75%858,143 8.12%201210,870,55010,076,854 7.41%793,696 8.28%As of 2022[16]Major attractions[edit]Beaches[edit]Main article: Beaches in KeralaKovalam beachFlanked on the western coast by the Arabian Sea, Kerala one of the  long coastline of 580\\xa0km (360\\xa0mi); all of which is virtually dotted with sandy beaches.Kovalam beach near Thiruvananthapuram was among the first beaches in Kerala to attract tourists. Rediscovered by back-packers and tan-seekers in the 1960s and followed by hordes of hippies in the 1970s, Kovalam today is one of  the most visited beaches in the state.[17][18][19]Other popularly visited beaches in the state include those at Kappad, Alappuzha, Kozhikode[citation needed] Beach, Marari Beach (Mararikulam, Alappuzha), Thumpoly (thumpoly beach ) Alappuzha,Alappuzha , Nattika (Thrissur), Vadanappilly beach (Thrissur), Cherai Beach, Ponnani beach, Bekal, Kappad Beypore beach, Marari beach, Fort Kochi, and Varkala. The Muzhappilangad Beach at Kannur and Thikkodi Beach at Kozhikode are the only two drive-in beach in India. Marari beach was rated as one of the world\\'s top five Hammock Beaches by the National Geographic survey and has been cited[20] in the international press.Backwaters[edit]Main article: Kerala BackwatersBoating at Biyyam Lake near PonnaniA Kettuvallam at Kavvayi Backwaters, NileshwaramThe backwaters in Kerala are a chain of brackish lagoons and lakes lying parallel to the Arabian Sea coast (known as the Malabar Coast). Houseboat or Kettuvallam rides in  backwaters are a major tourist attraction in kerala. Backwater tourism is centered mostly around of Kerala like Alleppey, Kumarakom, Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam, Ponnani, Kavvayi Backwaters, Vembanad and Bekal. Boat races held during festival seasons are also a major tourist attraction in the backwater regions.The backwater network includes large lakes such as the Ashtamudi Lake, the largest among them, linked by 1500\\xa0km of canals, both man-made and natural and fed by several rivers, and extending virtually the entire length of Kerala state. The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range.[21]Hill stations[edit]Munnar HillscapeSithar Kundu View Point at Nelliyampathy, Palakkad Dist. Kerala, South IndiaEastern Kerala consists of land encroached upon by the Western Ghats; the region thus includes high mountains, gorges, and deep-cut valleys. The Western Ghats is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the 36 biodiversity hotspots in the world. The wildest lands are covered with dense forests, while other regions lie under tea and coffee plantations (established mainly in the 19th and 20th centuries) or other forms of cultivation.The Western Ghats rise an average to 1500 m elevation above sea level. Some of the popular hill stations in the region are Munnar, Vagamon, Paithalmala, Wayanad, Nelliyampathi, Nilambur, Elapeedika, Peermade, Thekkady, Ponmudi and Kalvary Mount.Wildlife[edit]Main article: Wildlife of KeralaSilent Valley National Park in Palakkad is home to the largest population of lion-tailed macaque. They are among the world\\'s rarest and most threatened primates.Athirappilly Falls at Thrissur. Wildlife of Kerala is mainly concentrated in the forests of Western GhatsMost of Kerala, whose native habitat consists of wet evergreen rainforests at lower elevations and highland deciduous and semi-evergreen forests in the east, is subject to a humid tropical climate. However, significant variations in terrain and elevation have resulted in a land whose biodiversity registers as among the world\\'s most significant. Most of Kerala\\'s significantly biodiverse tracts of wilderness lie in the evergreen forests of its easternmost districts. Kerala also hosts two of the world\\'s Ramsar Convention-listed wetlands: Lake Sasthamkotta and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands are noted as being wetlands of international importance. There are also numerous protected conservation areas, including 1455.4\\xa0km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. In turn, the forests play host to such major fauna as Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), Nilgiri tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius), and grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macroura).[22] More remote preserves, including Silent Valley National Park in the Kundali Hills, harbour endangered species such as the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), Indian sloth bear (Melursus (Ursus) ursinus ursinus), and gaur (the so-called \"Indian bison\"—Bos gaurus). More common species include Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), chital (Axis axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), gray langur, flying squirrel, swamp lynx (Felis chaus kutas), boar (Sus scrofa), a variety of catarrhine Old World monkey species, gray wolf (Canis lupus), and common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). Many reptiles, such as king cobra, viper, python, various turtles and crocodiles are to be found in Kerala—again, disproportionately in the east. Kerala\\'s avifauna include endemics like the Sri Lanka frogmouth (Batrachostomus moniliger), Oriental bay owl, large frugivores like the great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) and Indian grey hornbill, as well as the more widespread birds such as peafowl, Indian cormorant, jungle and hill myna, Oriental darter, black-hooded oriole, greater racket-tailed and black drongoes, bulbul (Pycnonotidae), species of kingfisher and woodpecker, jungle fowl, Alexandrine parakeet, and assorted ducks and migratory birds. Additionally, freshwater fish such as kadu (stinging catfish—Heteropneustes fossilis) and brackishwater species such as Choottachi (orange chromide—Etroplus maculatus, valued as an aquarium specimen) also are native to Kerala\\'s lakes and waterways.Historical monuments[edit]See also: History of KeralaPanoramic view from inside Bekal Fort, the largest fort in KeralaHistorical monuments in Kerala include palaces, forts, and religious institutions.[23] Notable forts include Bekal Fort, Arikady fort, Chandragiri fort, Hosdurg Fort, Palakkad Fort, Thalassery Fort, Fortaleza da São Tomé, Fort Kochi, St Thomas Fort, East Fort and Anchuthengu Fort.[23] Notable palaces include Padmanabhapuram Palace, Kanakakkunnu Palace, Kowdiar Palace, Mattancherry Palace, Arakkal Palace, Shakthan Thampuran Palace, Hill Palace etc.[23] The Malabar Coast is also home to some of the oldest temples, oldest mosques, oldest churches, and oldest synagogues in South Asia.[23] The historic trading food streets in Kerala include the S.

The first Biennale in India was conducted in Kochi from 12 December 2012 till 13 March 2013.[25]Medical tourism[edit]Arya Vaidya Sala, KottakkalMedical tourism, promoted by traditional systems of medicine like Ayurveda and Siddha, is widely popular in the state, and draws increasing numbers of tourists. Kerala is popularly known as hub of Ayurveda. The medical tourism segment of Kerala is known for its reputation.[26]Culture[edit]Main articles: Arts of Kerala and Culture of KeralaKathakali is one of a major form of classical Indian danceVishnu Moorthy Theyyam in Naduvilathu Kottam near Payyannur, Kannur.Theyyam is a Hindu religious ritual practiced in northern KeralaKalaripayattu is an Indian martial art that originated in KeralaKerala\\'s culture is mainly Hindu in origin, deriving from a greater Tamil-heritage region known as Tamilakam. Later, Kerala\\'s culture was elaborated on through centuries of contact with overseas cultures.[27] Native performing arts include koodiyattom, kathakali—from katha (\"story\") and kali (\"play\")—and its offshoot Kerala Natanam, koothu (akin to stand-up comedy), mohiniaattam (\"dance of the enchantress\"), thullal, padayani, thirayattam, and theyyam. Other arts are more religion- and tribal-themed. These include chavittu nadakom, oppana (originally from Malabar), which combines dance, rhythmic hand clapping, and ishal vocalisations. However, many of these art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among most ordinary Keralites, who look to more contemporary art.[citation needed]Several ancient ritualised arts are Keralite in origin; these include kalaripayattu (kalari (\"place\", \"threshing floor\", or \"battlefield\") and payattu (\"exercise\" or \"practice\")). Among the world\\'s oldest martial arts, oral tradition attributes kalaripayattu\\'s emergence to Parasurama. Other ritual arts include Thirayattam, theyyam, poorakkali and Kuthiyottam. Thirayattam is a ritual performing folk art form of South Malabar region. Processions often include traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam.[citation needed]In respect of Fine Arts, the state has an abounding tradition of both ancient and contemporary art and artists. The traditional Kerala murals are found in ancient temples, churches and palaces across the State. These paintings, mostly dating to between the 9th to 12th centuries AD, display a distinct style, and a colour code which is predominantly ochre and green.[citation needed]Kerala is known for its religious diversity. The major religions are Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Jainism, Judaism, Sikhism and Buddhism have smaller followings.[citation needed] The state\\'s historic ties with the rest of the world have resulted in the state having many notable temples, churches and mosques. Kerala is home to the Kottakkavu church, one of the first churches in India founded by Thomas the Apostle when he reached Indian shores, Cheraman Mosque, the first mosque in India, which is considered to have existed even before the death of the Muhammad and Paradesi Synagogue, which is the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations.[citation needed]Recognising the potential of tourism in the diversity of religious faiths, related festivals and structures, the tourism department launched a \"Pilgrimage tourism\" project.[28][29] Major pilgrim tourism attractions include Guruvayur, Sabarimala, Malayatoor, Paradesi Synagogue, Arthunkal, Thumpoly church, St. Mary\\'s Forane (Martha Mariam) church, Kuravilangad built in 105 A.D, Attukal Pongala (which has the Guinness record for being the largest gathering of women in the world), and Chettikulangara Bharani.Here are a few Kerala-based tour operators that played a significant role in boosting tourism in the state:Golden Triangle India ToursWanderful Holidays LLCWorld Travel ExperiencesPayless tours indiaSwastik India JourneysKerala Tour Packages [30]Bamba TravelExplore!Gallery[edit]Jatayu Earth\\'s Center Nature ParkBekal FortSt. Angelo FortEdakkal cavesPookode LakeSargaalaya Crafts VillageKottakkunnuMalampuzha garden damYakshiVadakkunnathan TempleAthirapally WaterfallsSt. George\\'s Syro-Malabar Forane Church, EdappallyChinese fishing nets in KochiKochi International MarinaMarine Drive, KochiBolgatty PalaceRamakkalmeduMunnarVaikom Sree Mahadeva TempleAlappuzhaAmbalappuzha Sree Krishna Swamy TempleSabarimalaPadmanabhaswamy TempleSee also[edit]Society portalIndia portalHistory of KeralaTourism in IndiaNotes and references[edit]Listen to this article (2 minutes)This audio file was created from a revision of this article dated 8\\xa0March\\xa02006\\xa0(2006-03-08), and does not reflect subsequent edits.(Audio help\\xa0· More spoken articles)^ \"Kerala Tourism: Paradises in the world\".

      "Summary: The  Maramon Convention, is the largest Christian convention in Asia,  held at Maramon,Thiruvalla,Pathanamthitta, Kerala, India annually in February on the vast sand-bed of the Pampa River next to the Kozhencherry Bridge. It is organised by Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association, the missionary wing of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church.\n",
      "The origin and growth of this annual get-together for one week at a stretch can be traced to the great revival movement which gathered momentum during the reformation period in the Syrian Churches of Kerala under the pioneering leadership of Abraham Malpan in the latter part of the 19th century. This brought about the transformation in resurgence of the ancient apostolic Churches in Kerala founded by St. Thomas the Apostle approximately in AD 52.\n",

      "Summary: Wayanad (Malayalam: [ʋɐjɐnaːɖɨ̆]) is a district in the north-east of the Indian state of Kerala, with its administrative headquarters at the municipality of Kalpetta. It is the only plateau in Kerala. The Wayanad Plateau forms a continuation of the Mysore Plateau, the southern portion of the Deccan Plateau. It is set high in the Western Ghats with altitudes ranging from 700 to 2,100 meters. Vellari Mala, a 2,240 m (7,349 ft) high peak situated on the trijunction of Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode districts, is the highest point in Wayanad district. The district was formed on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district in Kerala, by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts. An area of 885.92 km2 in the district is forested. Wayanad has three municipal towns—Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery. There are many indigenous tribes in this area. \n",
      "The Kabini River, a tributary of the Kaveri River, originates at Wayanad. Wayanad district, along with the Chaliyar valley in the neighbouring Nilambur (Eastern Eranad region) in Malappuram district, is known for natural gold fields, which are also seen in other parts of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The Chaliyar river, which is the fourth longest river of Kerala, originates on the Wayanad plateau. The historically important Edakkal Caves are located in Wayanad district.\n",
      "Wayanad district is bordered by Karnataka (Kodagu, Chamarajanagar and Mysore districts) to the north and north-east, Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris district) to the south-east (it is the only district that shares border with both the neighbouring states of Kerala), Malappuram to the south, Kozhikode to the south-west and Kannur to the north-west. Pulpally in Wayanad boasts the only Lava-Kusha temple in Kerala and Vythiri has the only mirror temple in Kerala, which is a Jain temple. Varambetta mosque is the oldest Muslim mosque of Wayanad. Wayanad is famous for its role in the Cotiote War, where Pazhassi Raja with the help of the Kurichya tribe in association with Hindus and Muslims of the Malabar region launched a revolt against the British. Kaniyambetta and  Muttil Panchayaths are the centrally located Panchayaths with the best access from all corners of Wayanad, while Tavinjal Panchayath is on the northeast border with Kannur district. The edicts found in the caves of Ambukuthi Mala are evidence that occupation dates from the beginning of the New Age Civilisation.\n",
